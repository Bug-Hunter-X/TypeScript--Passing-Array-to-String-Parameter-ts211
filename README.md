This example demonstrates a common TypeScript error that occurs when attempting to pass an array to a function expecting a string.  The code includes a function `greeter` designed to greet a person by name. However, when an array is passed, TypeScript throws an error because of type mismatch. The solution shows how to address this by correctly handling the expected parameter type, either by changing the function signature or modifying the input.
